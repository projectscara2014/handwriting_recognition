    "\n",
    "Where,\n",
    "    * y(x) = target output expected for the given input \"x\"\n",
    "    * a = actual output determined for the given input\n",
    "    * n = number of training inputs given over whom the summation is\n",
    "\n",

    "#### Gradient Descent\n",
    "* Our aim is to reduce the cost function output (which is nothing but Mean Squared Error) and thus reduce the error\n",
    "* To reduce the cost function, we are interested in finding the \"gradient descent\" or the \"direction of the point of minima\" and hence we can reduce the error.\n",
    "* So we need to change the weights and biases (denoted as $\\Delta v$) in such a way that changing it, can allow us to reduce cost function (denoted as $\\Delta C$).\n",
    "* We take the gradient descent of the cost function, (denoted as$\\nabla C$) which is nothing but a vector of partial derivatives of \"C\" with respect to weights or biases (\"v\")\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\nabla C$ ≡ {$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial v1}$,$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial v2}$,$\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial v3}$ . . .}\n",
    "* Hence, $\\Delta C \\approx \\nabla C \\cdot \\Delta v$\n",
    "* To decrease the cost, we need to ensure that $\\Delta C$ is negative.\n",
    "* For this, we take $\\Delta v = -\\eta\\nabla C$ which makes $\\Delta C \\approx -\\eta\\left \\| \\nabla C  \\right \\|^2$ and therefore always negative.\n",
    "* $\\nabla C$ is computed by finding $\\frac{\\partial C}{\\partial v}$ for all v as shown below:\n",
    "* We know,\n",
    "    * $C = \\frac{1}{2n} *\\left \\| y(x)-a \\right \\|^2$\n",
    "    * $y(x) = σ(z)$\n",
    "    * $z = \\sum_{j} w_{j}x_{j} - b$\n",

    "#### Stochastic mini-batches\n",
    "* For the purpose of better recognition, a neural network must be fed with a lot of training data. This training data must be random and not ordered. Thus we feed random inputs to our network. Also the weights and biases are randomly assigned for best results. This is a heuristic approach that has been followed.\n",
    "* But doing this for many inputs can be computationally costly if weights have to be evaluated after each input\n",
    "* So we use the concept of using mini-batches that divide the input data into small batches and provide them to the network. The error is calculated over this batch and so are the various derivates involved. This is also a hueristic approach that helps reducing computation and results are approximately the same."
