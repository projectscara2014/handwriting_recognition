-------------------------------------

This is our final year project (August 2015 - April 2016).

This project is composed of two main parts:-

1) The Backend Part

2) The Frontend Part

--------------------------------------

The *Backend Part* consists of 2 major sections:-

i) MNIST-compatible Handwritten Character **Dataset Collection**.

ii) **Neural Network Training** on alphanumerical and special characters. Trained using self-created Dataset and the MNIST dataset.

--------------------------------------
The *Frontend Part* consists of 2 major sections:-

i) **Real Time Character Recognition**.

ii) **FPGA implementation** of Neural Network classifier.
