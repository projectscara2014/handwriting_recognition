# Real Time Handwritten Character Recognition using Image Processing and Neural Networks implemented on an FPGA

This repository is our final year project.

This project involves 2 main parts:-

1) The Backend Part

2) The Frontend Part

--------------------------------------

The *Backend Part* consists of 2 major sections:-

i) MNIST-compatible Handwritten Character **Dataset Collection**.

ii) **Neural Network Training** on alphanumerical and special characters. Trained using self-created Dataset and the MNIST dataset.

--------------------------------------
The *Frontend Part* consists of 2 major sections:-

i) **Real Time Character Recognition**.

ii) **FPGA implementation** of Neural Network classifier.


**Note: -** Specific Hardware is required to test sections of the project.

**Note: -** The FPGA device used was the Spartan 6 XC6SLX9 FPGA.
