# Real Time Handwritten Character Recognition using Image Processing and Neural Networks implemented on an FPGA

This repository is our final year project.

This project involves 2 main parts:-

1) The Backend Part

2) The Frontend Part

The *Backend Part* consists of 2 major sections:-

i) MNIST-compatible Handwritten Character **Dataset Collection** part

ii) **Neural Network Training** on alphanumerical and special characters. Trained using self-created Dataset and the MNIST dataset.


The *Frontend Part* consists of 2 major sections:-

i) **Real Time Character Recognition**

ii) **FPGA implementation** of Neural Network classifier


**Note: -** Soecific Hardware may be required to test out the project as described above.
