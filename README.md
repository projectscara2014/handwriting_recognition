######Collaborators: Riyansh Karani, Dhruv Reshamwala, Akash Rana, Kishore Saldanha
My final Year project, involving a neural network and image processing based system for handwriting recognition.
Working on an FPGA implementation for the same.

This is work in Progress.

Done in collaboration with [dhr9](https://github.com/dhr9), for the other half of this project, please visit [his page](https://github.com/dhr9/HandwritingRecognition_using_ImageProcessing_and_NeuralNetworks_on_an_FPGA)
